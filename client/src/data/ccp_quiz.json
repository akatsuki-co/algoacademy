    "answers": {
      "a": "Each region consists of a collection of VPCs",
      "b": "Regions are Content Delivery Network (CDN) endpoints for CloudFront",

    },
    "correct_answer": ["c", "e"],
    "topic": "ccp",
    "explanation": "A region is not a collection of VPCs, it is composed of at least 2 AZs. VPCs exist within accounts on a per region basis. AZs (not regions) have direct, low-latency, high throughput and redundant network connections between each other. Edge locations (not regions) are Content Delivery Network (CDN) endpoints for CloudFront."

    "answers": {
      "a": "Outsource all security responsibility",
      "b": "Gain access to free technical support services",

    "correct_answer": ["c", "d"],
    "topic": "ccp",
    "explanation": "AWS offers elastic computing with the ability to adjust workloads, monitor utilization and programatically make changes. You can improve agility and elasticity through services such as Auto Scaling, ELB and highly scalable services such as S3 and Lambda. You do not get free technical services with AWS or end-to-end operational management of the entire infrastructure stack. You are still responsible for ensuring the security of your application, users and data."
