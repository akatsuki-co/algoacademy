As objects become less popular, individual POPs might remove those objects to make room for more popular content. Regional edge caches have a larger cache than an individual POP, so objects remain in the cache longer at the nearest regional edge cache location. This helps keep more of your content closer to your viewers, reducing the need for CloudFront to go back to your origin server, and improving overall performance for viewers."

      "d": "When you create a trail in the AWS Management Console, the trail applies to all AWS Regions by default."
    },
    "correct_answer": ["d"],
    "topic": "ccp",
    "explanation": "The option that says: CloudTrail is able to capture application error logs from your EC2 is incorrect because CloudTrail actually does not capture error logs in your EC2 instances. You may instead use CloudWatch Logs for this purpose. The option that says: CloudTrail charges you for every management event trail created is incorrect because actually, CloudTrail does not charge you for your first management trail, but only the additional management trails you create after the first one."

      "c": "Region",
      "d": "Edge location"

    "correct_answer": ["a"],
    "topic": "ccp",
    "explanation": "A VPC spans all the Availability Zones in the region. After creating a VPC, you can add one or more subnets in each Availability Zone. Each subnet must reside entirely within one Availability Zone and cannot span zones. Availability Zones are distinct locations that are engineered to be isolated from failures in other Availability Zones. By launching instances in separate Availability Zones, you can protect your applications from the failure of a single location."

    },
    "correct_answer": ["d"],
    "topic": "ccp",
    "explanation": "For automatic scaling of your compute capacity, you need another service called AWS Auto Scaling to go with your load balancers. Although ELBs do add security for your instances, it is not solely because of security groups. Security groups can be used directly with EC2 instances, so this statement is not the best answer for the scenario."

Tags enable you to categorize your AWS resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment. This is useful when you have many resources of the same type—you can quickly identify a specific resource based on the tags you've assigned to it."
