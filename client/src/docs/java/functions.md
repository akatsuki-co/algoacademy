## Functions

---

In Java, all function definitions must be inside classes. We also call functions methods.

- `static` means this method belongs to the class Main and not to a specific instance of Main.
- `void` means this method doesn't return a value.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void foo() {
        // Do something here
    }
}
```
